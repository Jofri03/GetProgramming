/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Add a third property to each book.
 *    Don't forget the commas.
 *
 * The linear format for book1 is okay for
 * objects with few properties but becomes
 * unwieldy as more properties are added.
 *
 * 2) Add spaces to book2 properties so that
 *    the colons line up.
 *    Do you prefer the objects formatted that way?
 *
 * 3) Reformat book1 so that it has the same
 *    layout as book2.
