/* Get Programming with JavaScript

 * Replacing one string with another
 */

var before = "Hello to Jason";

var after = before.replace("Jason", "Stephen");

console.log(before);
console.log(after);



/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Run the program
 *
 * 2) Before the calls to console.log,
 *    add a line of code to replace
 *    "Hello" with "Goodbye"
 *
 * 3) Write a function that takes
 *    a string and returns a new
 *    string with the first occurence
 *    of "Jason" replaced by "Stephen"
 *
 *    e.g. jasonToStephen("Hello to Jason")
 *    should return "Hello to Stephen"
