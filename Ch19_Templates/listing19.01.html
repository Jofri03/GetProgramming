<!-- Further Adventures

1) Run the program to see the output generated
   when the placeholders are filled with data.

2) Move the first {{author}} placeholder into
   its own paragraph and run the program again.

3) Look at the post data in the JavaScript panel.
   Notice how the property names (the keys) match
   the placeholders.

4) Add a fifth post to the posts array and run
   the program again.
