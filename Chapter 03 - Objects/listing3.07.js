var player1 = { name : "Kandra"  ,  health : 50 };

var player2 = {
    name : "Dax",
    health : 40
};



/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Add a third property to each player.
 *    Don't forget the commas.
 *
 * The linear format for player1 is okay for
 * objects with few properties but becomes
 * unwieldy as more properties are added.
 *
 * 2) Add spaces to player2 properties so that
 *    the colons line up.
 *    Do you prefer the objects formatted that way?
 *
 * 3) Reformat player1 so that it has the same
 *    layout as player2.
