// We can use variables to store information about the current player.


var playerName = "Simon";


// The 'var' keyword is used to create a variable, a label used for a value we want to store and retrieve in our program.

// We have chosen to call the variable 'playerName'. This is just a label. We chose a name that describes what the variable is for.

// = "Simon"
// We set our variable to the value "Simon".

// The semicolon, ';', is used to finish our instruction.


console.log(playerName);


// console.log will display information on the console.

// In this case, the value of the variable 'playerName' is shown on the console.
