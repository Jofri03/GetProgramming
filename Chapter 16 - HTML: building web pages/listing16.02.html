<!-- Further Adventures

     1) Add two more questions.
        Be careful to match opening and closing tags.
        Editing HTML can be quite fiddly.
        Don't forget the forward slash
        for the closing tags.

     2) The list of questions is between ol tags.
        Change the ol tags to ul tags.
        What happens to the output?

     3) Change just the opening ul tag
        back to an ol tag so the tags
        don't match.

        <ol> ... list ... </ul>

        The browser will do its best to make
        sense of the tags and display something
        reasonable. However, the unmatched
        tags are malformed HTML and should
        not be left in such a state.

     4) Fix the opening and closing list tags
        so they match.
