/* Get Programming with JavaScript
 * Listing 13.02
 * Loading JavaScript with a script tag
 * Requires the 'between' function
 */

var num = between(3, 7);
console.log(num);


/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Run the program 4 or 5 times.
 *
 * A random number between 3 and 7 inclusive
 * should be generated each time.
 *
 * The 'between' function that generates
 * the number is loaded via a
 * script element in the HTML panel.
 *
 * 2) Create a rectangle object with random
 *    length and width properties each
 *    between 1 and 10 units long.
 *
 * 3) Define a showArea function that accepts
 *    a rectangle as an argument and logs its
 *    area to the console.
 *
 *    > a 3 by 7 rectangle has area 21
