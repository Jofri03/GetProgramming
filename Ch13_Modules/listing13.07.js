/* Get Programming with JavaScript
 * Listing 13.07
 * Call me later
 */

var callMeLater = function () {
    console.log("What took you so long?");
};


/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Run the program.
 *
 * 2) At the prompt, call the
 *    callMeLater function.
 *
 *    > callMeLater()
 *
 * The function is available at the
 * console prompt because it was
 * assigned to a global variable,
 * callMeLater.
 *
 * 3) Add three calls to callMeLater
 *    to the program and run the
 *    program again.
 *
 * The function is available in the
 * program too. We're using the
 * function as 'code on demand.'
