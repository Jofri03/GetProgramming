# Adventures In Code
Creating a JavaScript adventure game to help teach programming concepts.

The focus will be on understanding and practising each concept rather than covering every feature of JavaScript.

The book could have sidebars or mini-chapters introducing some research into successful learning techniques that are not always intuitive. E.g. desirable difficulty, interleaving, spacing, repetition, testing as learning.  


## Part 1

### Chapter 1 - Programs and JavaScript
What is a program? What is JavaScript and why is it important?


### Chapter 2 - Adventures in Code - Welcome to Harmony
An overview of the adventure game to be built and how it will help the reader learn.


## Part 2 - Castles and Characters
Building the components that will be used in the full program.
Intro to jsBin and how to interact with the code examples.

### Chapter 3 - [Players and Properties](https://github.com/jrlarsen/AdventuresInCode/blob/master/Chpt3/chapter3.md)
Variables, basic objects, properties.
Logging to the console.

### Chapter 4 - [Locations and Loops](https://github.com/jrlarsen/AdventuresInCode/blob/master/Chpt4/chapter4.md)
Constructor functions, arrays.

### Chapter 5 - [Maps and Movement](https://github.com/jrlarsen/AdventuresInCode/blob/master/Chpt5/chapter5.md)
Prototypes.

### Chapter 6 - [Items and Inventory](https://github.com/jrlarsen/AdventuresInCode/blob/master/Chpt6/chapter6.md)
Putting it all together for a working game.
Immediately invoked function expressions. Don't pollute the global namespace.
Importing scripts - external class and map files.
Loose coupling.

### Chapter 7 - Challenges and Champions
Location exits may now need challenges to be overcome by using items.


## Part 3 - Buttons and Browsers

Minimal HTML.
Text box, button, div, h1, p.
Reacting to a click event.
Importing scripts, including a map file for the game.
Templating.

## Part 4 - Ajax and APIs
