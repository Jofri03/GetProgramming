# Adventures In Code
Creating a JavaScript adventure game to help teach programming concepts.

The focus will be on understanding and practising each concept rather than covering every feature of JavaScript.

The book could have sidebars or mini-chapters introducing some research into successful learning techniques that are not always intuitive. E.g. desirable difficulty, interleaving, spacing, repetition, testing as learning.  


## Part 1

### Chapter 1 - Programs and JavaScript
What is a program? What do programmers do? Programming as an art and science.  
Programming takes practice. It's not just learning key words, it's learning structures, patterns and best practices.  
What is JavaScript and why is it important? JavaScript in the browser and on the server.  
JavaScript libraries.  


### Chapter 2 - Adventures in Code - Mapping the Land
An overview of the adventure game to be built and how it will help the reader learn. A graphical representation of what will be covered in the book - a map.  
Overview of the three versions of the game we will build. Some code snippets but only as a taste of what is to come.  
* Example 1 - Intro to jsBin and interacting via the console.
* Example 2 - Browser based version. Interacting via form controls. View source. Browser developer tools and the console.
* Example 3 - Browser and server based version. Information to and from the server. Multiple players. Saving data locally and on the server.


## Part 2 - Characters and Components
Building the components that will be used in the full program.
Key programming concepts:  
* variables and values
* functions, arguments and efficiency
* basic intro to objects

### Chapter 3 - [Players and Properties](https://github.com/jrlarsen/AdventuresInCode/blob/master/Chpt3/chapter3.md)
Variables, basic objects, properties.
Logging to the console.

### Chapter 4 - [Locations and Loops](https://github.com/jrlarsen/AdventuresInCode/blob/master/Chpt4/chapter4.md)
Constructor functions, arrays.

### Chapter 5 - [Maps and Movement](https://github.com/jrlarsen/AdventuresInCode/blob/master/Chpt5/chapter5.md)
Prototypes.

### Chapter 6 - [Items and Inventory](https://github.com/jrlarsen/AdventuresInCode/blob/master/Chpt6/chapter6.md)
Putting it all together for a working game.
Immediately invoked function expressions. Don't pollute the global namespace.
Importing scripts - external class and map files.
Loose coupling.

### Chapter 7 - Challenges and Champions
Location exits may now need challenges to be overcome by using items.


## Part 3 - Buttons and Browsers
Moving to the browser.
Minimal HTML.
Text box, button, div, h1, p.
Reacting to a click event.
Importing scripts, including a map file for the game.
Templating.

## Part 4 - Ajax and APIs
Pulling info from a server.
Local storage.
Node.js? Websockets? Multiple players?
