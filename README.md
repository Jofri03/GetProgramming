# Adventures In Code
Creating a JavaScript adventure game to help teach programming concepts.

The focus will be on understanding and practising each concept rather than covering every feature of JavaScript.

The book could have sidebars or mini-chapters introducing some research into successful learning techniques that are not always intuitive. E.g. desirable difficulty, interteaving, spacing, repitition, testing as learning.
