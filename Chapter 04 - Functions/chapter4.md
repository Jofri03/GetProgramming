 */

var showPlayerInfo = function () {
  console.log("Player information for " + player.name);
  console.log("------------------------------");
  console.log(player.name + " is in " + player.location);
  console.log(player.name + " has health " + player.health);
  console.log("------------------------------");
};



/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Add a call to showPlayerInfo and run the program. What happens?
 *
 * 2) Declare a player variable but don't assign it a value. Run the program. What happens now?
 *
 * 3) Create an empty object and assign it to the player variable. Run the program again. Does the output change?
 *
 * 4) Add name, location and health properties to the player object. Run one more time. Is the output as expected?
 *

```

### Calling the showPlayerInfo function
[jsbin: Listing 4.06](http://jsbin.com/menebu/edit?js,console)
```javascript

  console.log(player.name + " has health " + player.health);
  console.log("------------------------------");
};

var player = player1;

showPlayerInfo();



/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Without creating a player2, assign player2 to the player variable. What happens when you call showPlayerInfo?
 *
 * 2) Create an empty object and assign it to a player2 variable. What happens when you call showPlayerInfo now?
 *
 * 3) Fill out player2 with the properties needed by showPlayerInfo. What happens when you call showPlayerInfo now?

### Using the same function with multiple objects

  console.log("Player information for " + player.name);
  console.log("------------------------------");
  console.log(player.name + " is in " + player.location);
  console.log(player.name + " has health " + player.health);
  console.log("------------------------------");
};

player = player1;
showPlayerInfo();

player = player2;
showPlayerInfo();

player = player3;
showPlayerInfo();



/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Create an object to represent a multiple choice quiz question
 *
 * 2) Create two more quiz question objects
 *
 * 3) Create a function to show the question and answer options
