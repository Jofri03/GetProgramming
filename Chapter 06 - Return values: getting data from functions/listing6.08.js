/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Change the two functions so they only
 *    show the first three letters of a
 *    player's name as part of the returned string.
 *    e.g. Kan... health 50
 *    e.g. Kan... in The Dungeon of Doom
 *
 * 2) Further change them so they also
 *    transform the names to upper case.
 *    e.g. KAN... health 50
 *    e.g. KAN... in The Dungeon of Doom
 *
