/* Further Adventures
 *
 * There is a JavaScript function to return the
 * smaller of two numbers.
 * e.g. Math.min(3, 8) returns 3
 * e.g. Math.min(45, 40) returns 40
 *
 * There is another function to return the
 * larger of two numbers.
 * e.g. Math.max(3, 8) returns 8
 * e.g. Math.max(45, 40) returns 40
 *
 * In the getLine function, you want the
 * lineLength to be between 0 and 40.
 *
 * 1) In the getLine function, before the return statement,
 *    add these two lines:
 *    lineLength = Math.max(0, lineLength);
 *    lineLength = Math.min(40, lineLength);
 *
 *    They will make sure lineLength is between 0 and 40.
 *
 * 2) Update the getPlayerInfo function so that
 *    the line separators are the same length
 *    as the string returned by getPlayerPlace,
 *    up to a length of 40.
 *    You can declare new variables if required.
